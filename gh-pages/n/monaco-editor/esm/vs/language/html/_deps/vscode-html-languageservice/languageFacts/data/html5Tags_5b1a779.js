Although the standard doesn\'t request a specific encoding, it suggests:\n\n*   Authors are encouraged to use [`UTF-8`](/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8).\n*   Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings to avoid security risk: browsers not supporting them may interpret harmful content as HTML. This happens with the `JIS_C6226-1983`, `JIS_X0212-1990`, `HZ-GB-2312`, `JOHAB`, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.\n\n**Note:** ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don\'t map the 8-bit code points `0x20` to `0x7E` to the `0x0020` to `0x007E` Unicode code points)\n\n*   Authors **must not** use `CESU-8`, `UTF-7`, `BOCU-1` and/or `SCSU` as [cross-site scripting](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.\n*   Authors should not use `UTF-32` because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from `UTF-16`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.\n*   The [`<meta>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element declaring the encoding must be inside the [`<head>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head "The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.") element and **within the first 1024 bytes** of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.\n*   This [`<meta>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element is only one part of the [algorithm to determine a page\'s character set](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm "Algorithm charset page").
